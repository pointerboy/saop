# SA:MP - Open source gamemode (Originally designed for Los Santos Police Department Training Server)

# NOTICE: I DO NOT LONGER WORK ON THIS MODE. 

# How can I contribute?
Make changes on your local machine then create an issue that follows a custom branch (branch name should fit issue or change name). After you create the branch, make a pull request and debate can begin.
# What goes into main-line and what not?
Contributors will choose but, all commits on origin branch are done by me.
# Can I add someone's work? 
Feel free to implement snippets. Adding full systems isn't allowed.
